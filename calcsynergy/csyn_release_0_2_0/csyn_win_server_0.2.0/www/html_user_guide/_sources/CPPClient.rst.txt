**CSyn C++ Client**
===================


----------------
**Introduction**
----------------

For Windows machine a Windows installation executable is available. For Linux, an archive file is available for download to a target machine.
CSyn C++ client consists of include and lib directories:
include directory contains CSyn C++ classes declarations
lib directory contains all required libraries

--------------------------------
**Module and Kernel management**
--------------------------------


CSyn C++ client provides set of functions to manage custom modules and kernels. This sample code shows how to remove existing module and create new one:

.. raw:: html
	:file: module_manager_cpp.html

This sample code shows how to create kernel:

.. raw:: html
	:file: kernel_manager_cpp.html



-----------------
**Job execution**
-----------------


CSyn C++ client provides set of functions to get the kernel object, create job and execute it. This sample code shows how to create and execute job:

.. raw:: html
	:file: job_run_cpp.html
	
--------------------------------
**Job execution asynchronously**
--------------------------------

CSyn C++ client provides set of functions to get the kernel object, create job and execute it asynchronously. This sample code shows  how to create and execute job asynchronously:

.. raw:: html
	:file: job_run_async_cpp.html
