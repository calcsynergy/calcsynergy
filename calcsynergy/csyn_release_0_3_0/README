This is the README file for the Calculation Synergy (CSyn) system.

In this document you will find a brief description of the directory layout,

Introduction
============

Calculation Synergy (CSyn) is a distributed general purpose computing system for Graphics Processing Units (GPU).
CSyn is a highly scalable software solution that allows application services to operate in an unattached to specific GPUs.
Multiple client applications can submit multiple requests in parallel and CSyn will handle these requests in parallel on different GPUs.
A scalable architecture will provide linear gains in performance with the addition of more hardware resources.
Current CSyn version supports CUDA as a parallel processing platform.


CUDA kernels execution
======================

The ability to easy integrate a new technology into a variety of different environments is a core requirement of any new technology.
CSyn offers support for multiple programming languages with the addition of a easy integration strategy.
The client applications can execute any CUDA kernel hosted on the CSyn using different languages, including C++, Python, Java and CSharp.
CSyn also provides a standards-based, flexible and intuitive programming model to simplify development process.
It provides the ability to create instances of Kernel objects, provide Kernel parameters values, and submit job to CSyn runtime environments
for execution. This job is virtualized and invoked on one of CSyn GPU and job results are returned to the client application.

Architecture
============

CSyn uses Service-Oriented Architecture as an architectural approach.
It includes three different components in its architecture:
- Clients components that create and submit service requests to the CSyn Director
- Engines services that host and run CUDA kernels on the CSyn GPUs
- Director service that assigns Clients job to Engines, load balance Engines and manages CSyn resources

Getting Started
===============

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See CSyn project user guid http://www.calcsynergy.com/html_user_guide/index.html for more details.

Prerequisites
=============

To run Director and Engine services CSyn requires to install CUDA 10.2 or higher.
See CUDA installation instructions [guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) for Windows and CUDA installation instructions guide https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html for Linux for more details.

Installation
============

To install CSyn system on your local machine follow the next steps:
- Downloads Director archive and extract it content to your destination. Update Director configuration file
- Start Director service
- Downloads Engine archive and extract it content to your destination. Update Engine configuration file
- Start one or more Engine services
See CSyn project user guide http://www.calcsynergy.com/html_user_guide/index.html for more details.
